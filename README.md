# Product Catalog (Single Page Application - SPA)

This project focuses on developing a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using **React.js** for a **product catalog**. The goal is to reinforce React knowledge and introduce key concepts like:

- Routing  
- Hooks  
- Loading spinners  
- Bootstrap styling  

The application simulates a real-world client project and must:

- Load product data from a server (API)  
- Display products as **cards**  
- Include a **search field** to filter products  
- Include a **category selector** for filtering  
- Allow navigation to a **product detail page** when a card is clicked

## Environment Requirements

To develop and run the application, ensure the following are installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 LTS)  
- **Git**  
- Code editor (Visual Studio Code or similar)  
- Basic knowledge of **HTML, CSS, JS, and React**
